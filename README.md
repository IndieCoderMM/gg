## About The Project

![A screenshot of 2048, dodger, and a maze running in separate windows.](assets/gameplay.png)

I like to play video games, probably like you. But I prefer smaller, more minimal games. And I figured the best way to keep games minimal is to play them from the CLI!

And as a developer, that's perfect because half of my computer time is spent in a terminal.

Enjoy playing terminal games :)
